# Fraud-Chargeback-Predictor

## Overview
This project is a predictive machine learning application designed to forecast chargebacks and detect fraudulent transactions. The model leverages Python and common ML libraries to provide accurate predictions, helping businesses minimize losses and improve decision-making.

The project is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit app**, allowing users to explore predictions and test scenarios without any local installation.

## Features
- Predicts likelihood of chargebacks and fraudulent activity
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Easy-to-use inputs for real-time predictions
- Demonstrates practical application of machine learning in finance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (or XGBoost/your specific ML library)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Optional: Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations

## How to Use
- Run the app via Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
